The DT

Despite IN

However RB

Two CD

This DT

Bernoulli NP
also RB
wrote VBD

questions NNS

Jean NP

Rond NP
d'Alembert NP

Together RB
Bernoulli NP
and CC
Euler NP
tried VBD
to TO
discover VB
more JJR
about IN
the DT
flow NN
of IN
fluids NNS
. .
In IN
particular JJ
, ,
they PRP
wanted VBD
to TO
know VB
about IN
the DT
relationship NN
between IN
the DT
speed NN
at IN
which WDT
blood NN
flows VBZ
and CC
its PRP$
pressure NN
. .
To TO
investigate VB
this DT
, ,
Daniel NP
experimented VBD
by IN
puncturing VBG
the DT
wall NN
of IN
a DT
pipe NN
with IN
a DT
small JJ
open JJ
ended JJ
straw NN
and CC
noted VBD
that IN
the DT
height NN
to IN
which WDT
the DT
fluid NN
rose VBD
up IN
the DT
straw NN
was VBD
related JJ
to IN
fluid NN
's POS
pressure NN
in IN
the DT
pipe NN
. .
Soon RB
physicians NNS
all RB
over IN
Europe NP
were VBD
measuring VBG
patients NNS
' PART
blood NN
pressure NN
by IN
sticking VBG
point NN
- HYPH
ended JJ
glass NN
tubes NNS
directly RB
into IN
their PRP$
arteries NNS
. .
It PRP
was VBD
not RB
until IN
about RB
170 CD
years NNS
later RBR
, ,
in IN
1896 CD
that IN
an DT
Italian JJ
doctor NN
discovered VBD
a DT
less RBR
painful JJ
method NN
which WDT
is VBZ
still RB
in IN
use NN
today NN
. .
However RB
, ,
Bernoulli NP
's POS
method NN
of IN
measuring VBG
pressure NN
is VBZ
still RB
used VBN
today NN
in IN
modern JJ
aircraft NN
to TO
measure VB
the DT
speed NN
of IN
the DT
air NN
passing VBG
the DT
plane NN
; :
that DT
is VBZ
its PRP$
air NN
speed NN
. .
Taking VBG
his PRP$
discoveries NNS
further RBR
, ,
Daniel NP
Bernoulli NP
now RB
returned VBD
to IN
his PRP$
earlier JJR
work NN
on IN
Conservation NP
of IN
Energy NP
. .
It PRP
was VBD
known VBN
that IN
a DT
moving JJ
body NN
exchanges VBZ
its PRP$
kinetic JJ
energy NN
for IN
potential JJ
energy NN
when WRB
it PRP
gains VBZ
height NN
. .
Daniel NP
realised VBD
that IN
in IN
a DT
similar JJ
way NN
, ,
a DT
moving JJ
fluid NN
exchanges VBZ
its PRP$
kinetic JJ
energy NN
for IN
pressure NN
. .
A DT
consequence NN
of IN
this DT
law NN
is VBZ
that IN
if IN
the DT
velocity NN
increases VBZ
then RB
the DT
pressure NN
falls VBZ
. .
This DT
is VBZ
exploited VBN
by IN
the DT
wing NN
of IN
an DT
aeroplane NN
which WDT
is VBZ
designed VBN
to TO
create VB
an DT
area NN
above IN
its PRP$
surface NN
where WRB
the DT
air NN
velocity NN
increases VBZ
. .
The DT
pressure NN
in IN
this DT
area NN
is VBZ
lower JJR
than IN
that DT
under IN
the DT
wing NN
, ,
so RB
the DT
wing NN
is VBZ
pushed VBN
upwards RB
by IN
the DT
relatively RB
higher JJR
pressure NN
under IN
the DT
wing NN
